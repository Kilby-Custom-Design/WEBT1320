<h3>About Me</h3>

<p>Hi my name is jacob kilby I was born and raised in Tennessee in a little town called spring city. I love to hunt and fish just like a lot of southen people but the biggest thing I love to do is design. In middle (spring city middle school) I started drawing anime, but could never really did good outside of drawing anime once. I got to high school (rhea county highschool) everything changed once I was in graphic design. we learn to print on t-shirts, and I fell in love with it I wanted to open up my own t-shirts printing company so bad once. I got out of high school I knew I was going to go to collage because I got 2 free years (Tennessee promise) so I might as well take it so I decided to go for the design part of the screen print to learn as much as I can. I live to hunt and fish but between working two jobs some time that gets really hard to do. I'm a gaming nerd I have every Playstation that they have made. I have xbox 360, and the xbox one, a wii, and the GameCube.  </p>
